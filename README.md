# 📝 Diary Formatter App

A simple JavaScript app that formats plain-text diary entries into a structured, styled interface with sections such as goals, schedule, notes, and typing practice.  

This project was built as a way to practice **JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and localStorage**. It helped me understand how to dynamically update the UI, render text into components, and manage saved data.
