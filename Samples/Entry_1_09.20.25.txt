Notes 
- I have an idea for a business. Right now there is heavy unemployment problem ion South Africa. This could be used to teach people skills needed for employment in a loan-like fashion. This means if employed I could get my money back through monthly payments. 
- Maybe allocating a fixed number of positions where dedicated student could learn now pay later. The rest would have to pay for tuition. Adding an online course where they could follow along with the lesson at a cheaper price could also work.
- This means that the courses the school teaches NEED to be in demand and the course needs to adequately prepare the students for the job market. Following along a students progess could give us better insight as to how to ensure that there are no gaps in the students' knowledge.
- IMPORTANT! I need to be aware of whether there are jobs to be had. If not create the illusion that all they lack are skills required for the job â€” that if they are qualified they WILL get the job.
