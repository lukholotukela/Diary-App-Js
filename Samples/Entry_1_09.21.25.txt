Typing Practice

Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you
Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you

I don't know where'd you gone
Cause you left me all alone
I don't know where'd you gone
Cause you left me all alone 
I don't know

Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you
Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you

It's dark in here
It's black and white now
Emo kid in a chair
Turn up the saturation
Zoom in on emo kid

Girl stands in the sky
Maybe a mirror 
She doesn't look so sure
Girl pulling down her dress
From all this random wind

Kid walks slow with a dead blank stare
This girl's doing the same 
So is he
And so is he 
And so is he
This guy looks weird
And he looks pissed 
Hot girl

And those damn kids keep breaking glass everywhere
Which somehow turn into a bunch of flowers
Exuse me there's something coming out of you
Guess she doesn't care

Emo kid falling into the darkness up until when
He fuses wit a guy who looks a lot just like him
Now he's got white hair and just wants to stare at me
