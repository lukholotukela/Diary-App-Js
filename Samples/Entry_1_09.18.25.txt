Typing Practice 

Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you
Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you

I don't know where'd you gone 
Cause you left me all alone
i don't know where'd you gone
Cause you left me all alone
I don't know 

Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you
Sometimes lonely fades away
Only getting lost with you

Just wanna feel this love of mine
I give no favors to any side
I'm just so ready for what I may find
I'll embrace everything that will come with my heart and mind

So what do you still want so deep 
Just who the hell are you tryna be
I guess it's really just hard to see
That we got everything that we felt that we both could need

Flower Matsuri, Summer Matsuri 
Pick and choose whatever calls to you 
and have'em live within your heart until they thrive and bloom
Autumn Matsuri, Winter days of leaves
Let's e,brace all that came with an open heart and dance away
